Last weekend I visited Grand Rapids, MI, for the first time and loved basically everything. Everywhere we ate was fantastic, but the most inspiring meal was this one from [Green Well](http://www.thegreenwell.com/):

>sage infused spaetzle, roasted sweet potatoes, purple cabbage, caramelized apples, red onions, pecans, Grump Goat cheese, BLiS maple brown butter

I'm recreating this at home ASAP, will report back.
