Meyer lemons live up to the hype! I'd never had them before, but I grabbed a few at the store because I know everyone &hearts;s them. When I was looking around for something to do with them, I found [this Smitten Kitchen recipe for lemon-yogurt-anything cake](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/04/lemon-yogurt-anything-cake/). I used fresh cranberries and the resulting cake was lovely: moist, flavorful, tart &amp; sweet.
