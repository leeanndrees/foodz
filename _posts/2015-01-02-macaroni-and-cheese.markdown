It's ok, guys, I found it: the best mac & cheese ever is [Martha's Macaroni and Cheese](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/05/marthas-macaroni-and-cheese/) at Smitten Kitchen. Seriously, no one needs to mess with another recipe ever again. This is decadently creamy and crispy on top and just right in every possible way – it's the epitome of comfort food, and the little touch of nutmeg is *sublime*. If your housemate made it on New Year's Day and skipped the bread on top you wouldn't even miss that part, and if you ate it on the couch with a side of roasted veggies, a couple episodes of [Dr. Katz](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV-WF5F6GkMGGJLVSKnzCLSULIRT-7cpQ&app=desktop), and the last of your hangover fading away, well, you'd be setting a damn fine tone for 2015.
