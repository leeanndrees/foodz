I saw [this internet thing about frying cheese in the waffle iron](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/how-to-waffle-iron-fried-cheese-queso-frito-recipe.html). While it sounded delicious and quite possibly life-changing, I was suspicious. It just seemed to good to be true; surely all that could come of putting that much cheese in your waffle iron would be a gigantic mess, right?

Wrong.

So, so wrong.

This photo does absolutely no justice to the melty, crispy, gooey, crunchy wonder that is waffled cheese. 

My friends & I waffled 3 different kinds of cheese. In order of goodness, they were:

1. Spanish cheese (grilling cheese similar to halloumi)
2. Muenster 
3. Pepper jack (this melted &amp; spread out lots more than the other ones, so it was messier, but still worth it)

The waffle iron will henceforth be known as the cheese iron in this household.

PS: Due to a friend's allergy, we used gluten-free all-purpose flour and panko, and everything still worked beautifully.
