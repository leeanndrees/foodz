I had some leftover cr&ecirc;pes so I covered one with peanut butter & sliced bananas, put it under the broiler for a bit, and then added leftover cinnamon-maple whipped cream + toasted pecans.

Yesss.

Next time I would probably heat the bananas another way; the broiler didn't really touch them before it made the cr&ecirc;pe itself crispy. It would've been nice to have them a bit caramelized, but I am not remotely complaining because this was still an excellent, quick Wednesday morning breakfast.
