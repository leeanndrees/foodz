I bake bread almost every week and I've always loved trying new recipes. I first baked this one over a year ago, and I've hardly made anything else since, because it is perfect.

Ways I have not messed up this bread:
- substituting whatever weird combo of seeds I have on hand for the recommended ones
- using only a bunch of sunflower seeds
- never measuring the seeds
- adding too much olive oil for like several months because I misremembered the correct amount
- using 100% all-purpose flour

Maybe the best thing about this bread is that you can make it in an afternoon. My other favorite recipes feature slow overnight rises that make for excellent flavor development, but this one gets much of its flavor from the olive oil. That means you don't need to plan ahead so much.

The other best thing about this bread is the texture. The crust is crisp and crackly
