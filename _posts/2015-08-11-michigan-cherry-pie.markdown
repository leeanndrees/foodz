This is my finest accomplishment to date. It's basically one recipe of Smitten Kitchen's perfect [all-butter pie crust](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/) plus the filling from this [slab pie](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/07/sour-cherry-slab-pie/). The Michigan cutouts lost some of their detail in the oven but were still beautiful. This pie was happily eaten in celebration of a birthday all the way up in the UP.

(Extra bits of crust got some fennel and sesame seeds smashed into them, then were rolled out, cut into shapes, brushed with extra egg glaze, sprinkled with sugar, baked, and eaten as road trip snacks. Recommended.)
