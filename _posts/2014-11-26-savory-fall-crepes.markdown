Last night I made cr&ecirc;pes for the first time in a long time. I'm glad my sister had the idea; I'd been feeling uninspired and this turned out to be such a perfect meal. I used my housemate Nicole's handwritten recipe for the cr&ecirc;pes themselves:

###Nicole's Cr&ecirc;pe Batter
*Nicole's notes say "2 hungry ppl, 4 sorta hungry ppl" &mdash; consider doubling! The cr&ecirc;pes keep really well, you can refrigerate or freeze.*

####Ingredients:
- 1 C flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp butter, melted
- 1/2 C milk
- 1/2 C water
- 2 eggs

####Steps:
1. Whisk flour + eggs
2. Add milk + water
3. Add salt + butter, beat until smooth
4. Cook on medium-high heat

(I didn't actually see the steps when I was making these, I just threw everything together in whatever order made sense at the time.)

The batter was a little on the thick side, so I added some extra liquid. The internet said beer is a good addition to cr&ecirc;pe batter, which seemed like an excellent reason to crack open a seasonally inappropriate summer ale and stir in a few tablespoons. 

The internet also said you should strain the lumps from your cr&ecirc;pe batter, which is for insane people. This batter was a bit lumpy &amp; not a soul complained.

Cr&ecirc;pe technique is a little tricky if you're used to making pancakes; you want to get the batter super thin. You can swirl it around in the pan a bit &mdash; I found I got the hang of it after a few weird-looking (but still tasty) ones.

I cooked up the cr&ecirc;pes in the afternoon and stored them in the oven, with parchment paper between each one. Before dinner I set the oven to 200&deg; for as long as it took to prep the fillings.

###Fillings:
- brussels sprouts + onions, roasted (made ahead)
- onions, caramelized (leftover)
- spinach, chopped
- cremini mushrooms, sliced
- [Field Roast][fieldroast] smoked apple sage fake sausage
- goat cheese
- parmesan, shredded

Everything but the cheeses got thrown in a skillet (first the mushrooms, then the spinach, then everything else). Once the fillings were heated through and the "sausage" was a bit browned, it was time to pile everything onto cr&ecirc;pes, top with cheese, and enjoy.

Alongside a simple salad, this made for a fantastic dinner! The variety of textures & flavors in the filling was really satisfying. **Bonus**: it was quick to assemble, since I'd made the cr&ecirc;pes themesleves + prepped some of the veggies earlier in the day.
